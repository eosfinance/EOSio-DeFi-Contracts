/* This is the EFi NFT presale minting contract */
/* This is the simplest of the EFi contracts thus far */
// Users can send EOS to the NFT contract.
// The contract must check that not all the NFTs have been reserved (sold out)
// After that the contract must check how much EOS has been sent
// If they send too little EOS, refund them (or keep the EOS and ask to send the rest)
// You could have a scenario where you don't refund anyone at all. You just take EOS and reserve any number of NFTs.
// If by any chance we sell more than 100, then so be it, we sell out, we raise the number of total NFTs, I mean, they're already bought aren't they?
// So it just accepts EOS and logs each user in a table and their number of each of the DMD, DOP or HUB NFTs.
// Maybe we only need to have one table.
// We need a totals table and a buyers table
// Totals table just holds the number of NFTs sold for each of the three coins
// The buyers table will contain information about the order in which the NFTs were bought, and who bought them.
// The buyers table will log each purchase:
// order_nr(key) : account_name : amount_dmd : amount_dop : amount_hub
// So a person can have multiple buys, and multiple NFTs bought in each of these buys, but a single transfer and subsequent purchase will only ever be for a single Coin (DMD or HUB or DOP).
// A user has to do three separate transfers to get all three NFTs
// Users will send their EOS to nft.efi with memo "dmd" or "hub" or "dop"
